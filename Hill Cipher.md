# Hill Cipher Implementation in Python
This code implements the **Hill Cipher**, a classical cryptographic algorithm that uses linear algebra (matrix multiplication) to encrypt and decrypt messages. It works by dividing the message into blocks of `n` characters and encrypting each block using a matrix derived from the key.

### Key Components:

1. **Matrix Operations**:
   - The Hill cipher relies on matrix multiplication. The key is transformed into a square matrix (key matrix), and blocks of the message are converted into vectors. Encryption is done by multiplying the key matrix with the message vectors.

2. **Steps**:
   - **Encryption**: The message is divided into equal-sized blocks, and each block is converted into a vector. This vector is multiplied by the key matrix to get the cipher vector. The result is then converted back into text to form the ciphertext.
   - **Decryption**: To decrypt, the inverse of the key matrix is multiplied with the cipher vector to recover the original message.

### Functions Explained:

1. **`getKeyMatrix(key, n)`**:
   - Takes the `key` (a string) and its length `n` to form a square matrix (`keyMatrix`).
   - Each character in the key is converted to a number (A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25) using the formula `ord(char) % 65`.
   - The matrix is populated row-wise with the values from the key.

2. **`encrypt(message, keyMatrix, n)`**:
   - Encrypts a block of `n` characters from `message` using the `keyMatrix`.
   - The message characters are converted into a vector (`messageVector`), and matrix multiplication is performed (`keyMatrix * messageVector`). The result is then converted back into characters to form part of the ciphertext.

3. **`modInverse(a, m)`**:
   - Finds the modular inverse of `a` under modulo `m`. This is required to compute the inverse of the key matrix during decryption. It ensures that the matrix operations can be reversed.

4. **`getCofactor(matrix, temp, p, q, n)`**:
   - A helper function to compute the cofactor of a matrix. This is used in finding the determinant and adjoint of the matrix, which are required for matrix inversion.

5. **`determinant(matrix, n)`**:
   - Recursively computes the determinant of a matrix. The determinant is essential for determining if a matrix is invertible.

6. **`adjoint(matrix, adj)`**:
   - Computes the adjoint of the matrix. The adjoint is a key step in finding the inverse of the matrix.

7. **`getInverseMatrix(matrix, n)`**:
   - Computes the inverse of the `matrix` modulo 26 using its determinant and adjoint. The inverse matrix is used during decryption to reverse the encryption process.

8. **`decrypt(ciphertext, keyMatrix, n)`**:
   - Decrypts a block of ciphertext using the inverse of the `keyMatrix`. It performs matrix multiplication between the inverse key matrix and the ciphertext vector to recover the original message block.

### Main Logic:

1. **Input**:
   - The user is prompted to input the `message` (plaintext) and the `key`. Both are converted to uppercase, and spaces are removed.
   - The key length must be a perfect square (e.g., 4, 9, 16, etc.), as it is converted into a square matrix. If the key length isn't a perfect square, the program exits with an error message.
   
2. **Padding**:
   - If the length of the message is not a multiple of `n` (the size of the key matrix), the message is padded with 'X' to make it a multiple of `n`.

3. **Key Matrix Generation**:
   - The `getKeyMatrix` function is called to generate the key matrix from the input key.

4. **Encryption**:
   - The message is processed block by block (of size `n`). Each block is encrypted using the `encrypt` function, and the resulting blocks are concatenated to form the final ciphertext.

5. **Decryption**:
   - Similarly, the ciphertext is processed block by block. Each block is decrypted using the `decrypt` function, and the decrypted blocks are concatenated to form the original plaintext.

### Example:

Suppose the user enters:
- `message = "HELLO"`
- `key = "GYBNQKURP"` (a 3x3 matrix, so `n = 3`)

1. The `keyMatrix` will be:
   ```
   [[6, 24, 1],
    [13, 16, 10],
    [20, 17, 15]]
   ```

2. The message will be padded with 'X' to make it a multiple of 3: `HELLO -> HELLOX`.

3. The message is broken into two blocks: `HEL` and `LOX`.

4. Encryption is done block by block:
   - `HEL` is encrypted using the key matrix to produce a part of the ciphertext.
   - `LOX` is similarly encrypted.

5. Decryption reverses the process, recovering the original message "HELLO".
